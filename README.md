# ðŸš• Uber Fares Dataset Analysis â€“ Power BI Project

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

The objective of this analysis is to explore the **Uber Fares Dataset** from Kaggle to gain meaningful insights into ride patterns, fare distribution, temporal trends, and operational performance. By using **Python for data preprocessing** and **Power BI for visualization**, this project provides a data-driven approach to understanding how Uber fares vary over time, location, and peak hours.

Through the creation of an interactive dashboard, this project enables users to:
- Analyze fare distribution across various times of the day and days of the week.
- Identify high-demand periods and potential peak hours.
- Discover temporal trends in Uber operations (hourly, daily, monthly).
- Visualize the geographic spread of ride pickups (if location data available).

The final dashboard and report offer actionable insights that could support operational optimization, pricing strategy, and customer experience improvement for ride-hailing services.
